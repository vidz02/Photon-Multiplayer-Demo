# Photon Multiplayer Demo (Unity)

A lightweight multiplayer demo project built using Unity and Photon PUN 2. Designed to showcase fundamental real-time multiplayer features like player movement, name syncing, color syncing, shooting, and basic UI.

## 🎮 Features

- **Real-time multiplayer** using Photon PUN 2
- **Player spawning** with unique names
- **Randomized player colors** synced across network
- **Bullet firing** with networked instantiation
- **Camera follow** for local player only
- **Clean UI** for name entry and connection
- **Late joiners** see synced players correctly

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Unity `2022.3 LTS`
- Photon PUN 2 (Free tier)
- C# (MonoBehaviour + Photon callbacks)
- IPunObservable for syncing player state
- RPCs for event-based logic
